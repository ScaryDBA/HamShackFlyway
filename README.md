# Flyway Command Line Demo
The code in this repository is for use with the open source version of Flyway (flywaydb.org). It represents a simple set of scripts that are run in order to deploy a database. For your use, at a minimum, you'll need to edit the flyway.toml file to replace the existing connection string.
